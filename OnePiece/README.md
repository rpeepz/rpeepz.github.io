## 💡 Tips for New Pirates!

1. **Save your points!** Don't spend them all at once
2. **Complete your starter arcs** before unlocking new ones
3. **Build a win streak** to earn bonus points faster
4. **Try different difficulties** against the bot to practice
5. **Unlock arcs slowly** - focus on collecting all cards from cheaper arcs first
6. **Play Draft War** for more points (25 vs 10 for duels!)
7. **Arc Packs are cheaper** than buying by rarity if you want specific arc cards

## 🎨 Card Pool System (Advanced!)

Once you have **25 or more cards**, you can create a **Card Pool**!

Your pool automatically picks your **25 best cards**:
1. First by rarity (SSS → F)
2. Then by power (highest first)
3. Then by name (A-Z)

Games will use cards from your pool when possible, giving you better cards to play with!
